  "readme": "# Markdown YAML front-matter to JSON\n\n`m2j.js` is used to read a folder of Markdown files, pulling out the YAML front matter from each, and saving it all as a JSON object.\n\nThis is especially useful if you have a folder full of Markdown files\nthat you want scanned and processed into a singl JSON file, which can\nthen be consumed by Angular on the client, cached in a Node server, or\nsaved in a nosql database.\n\nIn addition to moving the YAML to JSON, a few extra elements are created: \n\n-  `iso8601` [formatted][1] from `date` using [Moment.js][2]\n-  `preview` is first 70 or so characters of the actual raw markdown content, with ellipses at the end\n-  `basename` is the filename without the path or extension\n\n_Example_\n\n```\n% m2.js --help\n\n  Usage: m2j [options] <files>\n\n  Options:\n\n    -h, --help               output usage information\n    -V, --version            output the version number\n    -w --width <int>         max width of preview text [70]\n    -p --pretty              format JSON with newlines\n    -o --outfile <filename>  filename to save json to [output.json]\n    \n\n% m2j.js lottery.ms\n```\n\n**lottery.md**\n\n```\n---\ntitle: The Lottery Ticket\nauthor: Anton C.\ndate: \"2013-03-15 15:00\"\ntemplate: article.jade\ntags:\n  - Fiction\n  - Russian\n  \n---\n\nIvan Dmitritch, a middle-class man who lived with his family on an income of twelve hundred a year and was very well satisfied with his lot, sat down on the sofa after supper and began reading the newspaper. \n\n```\n\n**output**\n\n```\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"The Lottery Ticket\",\n      \"author\": \"Anton C.\",\n      \"date\": \"1893-04-01\",\n      \"template\": \"article.jade\",\n      \"tags\": [\n        \"Fiction\",\n        \"Russian\"\n      ],\n      \"preview\": \"Ivan Dmitritch, a middle-class man who lived with his family on an â€¦\",\n      \"iso8601Date\": \"1893-04-01T00:00:00-07:00\",\n      \"basename\": \"lottery.md\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\n[2]: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/\n",
